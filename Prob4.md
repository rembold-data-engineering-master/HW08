# Problem 4
- List of any other students you worked with:
- About how long did you work on this problem?


## Part A
Upload an ERD for your 3NF table(s)!


## Part B
Upload `process.sql`, which should include the queries to:
* Start a transaction
* Insert clean data into your new table(s)
* Remove data from the original `raw_data` table
* Commit the transaction
We'll see how to automate running this later in class.
